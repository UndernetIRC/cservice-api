# Email Assets

This directory contains assets used in email templates.

## Logo

Place your organization's logo here with the filename `logo.png`. This logo will
be embedded in emails that reference it with `<img src="cid:logo">`.

Recommended specifications:

- Format: PNG with transparency
- Size: 200-300px wide
- Resolution: 72-144 dpi
If no logo is found, emails will still be sent but without the logo image.
